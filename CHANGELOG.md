### BREAKING CHANGES

* potential -- the autogenerated Sub and user-supplied
Username were treated interchangeably before, but now are independent.
Previously lookups by the Sub attribute were possible, but it now
doesn't appear necessary so has been removed. Databases should be
unaffected.

### BREAKING CHANGES

* client ids are now validated and associated with
specific user pools.
* Nit pick of a breaking change, make the user pool
database representation match what AWS reponds with from the API;
keeping consistent with their response format should make it easier for
us to implement APIs later. Sorry for the breakage.

Migration steps:

1. Open any database json files and rename the UserPoolId key to Id
